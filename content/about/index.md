Hello! I'm Roopchand, a graduate Software Engineer based in Dublin, Ireland.

I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.

After graduating from [Dublin Business School](https://www.dbs.ie/), I joined Web Development Path at [IT Career Switch](https://itcareerswitch.co.uk/) where I learnt both frontend and backend technologies and worked on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.

With my passion towards coding and learning new skills I decided to restart my career in software development. In order to prepare for this, I started learning web development skills from last year.
